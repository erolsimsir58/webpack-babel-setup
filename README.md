# A simple setup with Webpack, Babel and ESLint

## Installation

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:erolsimsir58/webpack-babel-setup.git webpack-babel-setup`
2. `cd webpack-babel-setup`
3. Run `npm i` to install all NPM packages
4. Run `npm run build` to run Webpack and create a bundle.

The bundle is created in the `/dist` folder with the filename `dist.js`. All your own code should be added to the `src` folder. You can create modular JS files and export and import them.
